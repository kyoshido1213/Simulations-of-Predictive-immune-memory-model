# Simulations-of-Predictive-immune-memory-model
This repository includes codes for simulations of predictive immune memory model in "Adaptive discrimination of antigen risk by predictive coding in immune system" (under submission)

# Usage
1. To get started, download the project in this repository in your Terminal.

```
    git clone https://github.com/kyoshido1213/Simulations-of-Predictive-immune-memory-model.git　　　　
```

2. Move or copy [simulation_codes](simulation_codes) in Simulations-of-Predictive-immune-memory-model into the directory where you want to run MATLAB.

3. Main function is `simulation_all.m` . You can run all simulations of predictive immune memory model as shown in "Adaptive discrimination of antigen risk by predictive coding in immune system".


# Note
* I used three kinds of parameter sets (`get_para_final_new.m`,`get_para_final_new_fig4.m`,`get_para_final_new_fig5.m`).
  These parameters are different only in the parameters of antigen input in immunotherapy, so all other parameters are identical in the three parameter setting.
* If you want to know predictive immune memory model in detail, please check: Kana Yoshido and Honda Naoki. "Adaptive discrimination of antigen risk by predictive coding in immune system", which is under submission but you can check on bioRxiv (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.12.472285)
